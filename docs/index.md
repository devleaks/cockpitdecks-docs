# Welcome to Cockpitdecks

Cockpitdecks is an application, a set of python scripts to use external physical decks connected to a computer with X-Plane flight simulator.

External decks include the following make and models:

- Elgato Stream Deck small, Mk.2, XL, Plus, and Neo
- Loupedeck LoupedeckLive
- Berhinger X-Touch Mini

Recently, we added Web Decks, a simulator of any of the above deck in a web page! Web Decks were first developed as a development tool to speed up deck page creation, but Web Decks turned out to be fast and available everywhere, in particular on tablets. Yes, you read it, you can now have any of the above deck, for free, on a tablet, to use with X-Plane flight simulator.

Cockpitdecks can run on the same computer as X-Plane, or a remote computer, network-connected to X-Plane.

In Cockpitdecks, the [[Cockpit]] holds all your decks.
