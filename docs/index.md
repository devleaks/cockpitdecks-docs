The following make and models of decks have been tested and are known to work with Cockpitdecks:

- [Elgato Stream Deck](https://www.elgato.com/us/en/s/welcome-to-stream-deck) (all models work: Small, Mk.2, XL, Plus, and Neo)
- [Loupedeck Loupedeck Live](https://loupedeck.com/products/loupedeck-live/) (Loupedeck Live S, Loupedeck+, Loupedeck CT should also work but have not been tested)
- [Berhinger X-Touch Mini](https://www.behringer.com/product.html?modelCode=0808-AAF)

Cockpitdecks also provides *Web Decks*, an emulator of the above decks in a web page, in the context of this application. Yes, you read it, you can now have any of the above deck, reproduced on a tablet, to use with X-Plane flight simulator. For free.

Cockpitdecks can run on the same computer as X-Plane, or a remote computer, network-connected to X-Plane.

You can now proceed to the discovery of Cockpitdecks [[Concepts]], or directly jump to the [[Cockpit]] that holds all your decks. Or if you are impatient to try Cockpitdecks, head for [[Installation]].

**Post Scriptum**

Cockpitdecks currently only connects to X-Plane flight simulator. However, hooks are ready to connect to other simulators, like Microsoft Flight Simulator. Packages like [pysimconnect](https://github.com/patricksurry/pysimconnect) can be used to bridge Cockpitdecks and MSFS. Unfortunately, these packages only run on Microsoft Window platform because they require MSFS SDK only available on the MS Window platform. If a developer want to create the MSFS Cockpitdecks plugin, please contact me.

In this respect, X-Plane and Cockpitdecks, which runs on MS Windows, MacOS, and Linux, and accept interaction through network ports is a far more open.
