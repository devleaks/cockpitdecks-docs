# Welcome to Cockpitdecks

Cockpitdecks is an application to use *decks* connected to a computer with X-Plane flight simulator.

The following make and models have been tested and are known to work with Cockpitdecks:

- [Elgato Stream Deck](https://www.elgato.com/us/en/s/welcome-to-stream-deck) (all models work: Small, Mk.2, XL, Plus, and Neo)
- [Loupedeck Loupedeck Live](https://loupedeck.com/products/loupedeck-live/) (Loupedeck Live S, Loupedeck+, Loupedeck CT should also work but have not been tested)
- [Berhinger X-Touch Mini](https://www.behringer.com/product.html?modelCode=0808-AAF)

There also are *Web Decks*, an emulator of the above decks in a web page, in the context of this application. Yes, you read it, you can now have any of the above deck, reproduced on a tablet, to use with X-Plane flight simulator. For free.

Cockpitdecks can run on the same computer as X-Plane, or a remote computer, network-connected to X-Plane.

In Cockpitdecks, the [[Cockpit]] holds all your decks.

**Post Scriptum**

Currently, Cockpitdecks only connects to X-Plane flight simulator. However, hooks are ready to connect to other simulator, like Microsoft Flight Simulator. Packages like [pysimconnect](https://github.com/patricksurry/pysimconnect) can be used to bridge Cockpitdecks and MSFS. Unfortunately, these packages only run on Microsoft Window platform because they require MSFS SDK only available on the MS Window platform.

In this respect, X-Plane, which runs on MS Windows, MacOS, and Linux is a far more open.

If a developer want to create the MSFS Cockpitdecks plugin, please contact me.
