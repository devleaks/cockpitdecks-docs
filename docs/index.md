The following make and models of decks have been tested and are known to work with Cockpitdecks:

- [Loupedeck Loupedeck Live](https://loupedeck.com/products/loupedeck-live/) (Loupedeck Live S, Loupedeck+, Loupedeck CT should also work but have not been tested; the LoupedeckLive «clone»  [Razer stream controller](https://www.razer.com/mena-en/gaming-accessories/razer-stream-controller) also seems to work.)

In addition to above deck devices, Cockpitdecks also provides *Web Decks*, an emulation of the above decks in a web page, in the context of this application.

Web decks are not limited to reproducing existing deck models. It is possible to create a custom web decks, out of your imagination, provided it uses common interaction means like push buttons, encoder dials, sliders, and small screens (LCD/LED/TFT) to display images. The demonstration web deck was imagined to show off Cockpitdecks capabilities.
