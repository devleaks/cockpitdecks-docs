Currently, Cockpitdecks only interface with X-Plane flight simulator. However, hooks are ready to interface Cockpitdecks with other simulation software.

To interface a new simulator software with Cockpitdecks, it is necessary to create a Simulator Driver package.

Packages like [pysimconnect](https://github.com/patricksurry/pysimconnect) can be used to bridge Cockpitdecks and MSFS. These packages only run on Microsoft Window platform because they require MSFS SDK only available on the MS Window platform. If a developer want to create the MSFS Cockpitdecks plugin for Microsoft Flight Simulator, please [contact me](https://github.com/devleaks/cockpitdecks).
