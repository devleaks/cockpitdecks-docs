# X-Plane Weather

X-Plane weather is flexible and proposed with several variant. We designed a few set of X-Plane specific button representation to present these data sets.

- Weather from external source (METAR, TAF)
- Weather from X-Plane (from global items like METAR)
- Weather informations from X-Plane (from clouds and wind *layers*)

# Toliss Airbus Aircrafts

Toliss Airbus Aircrafts A319, A320, A321, and A340 share numerous functions, with particularities or specialties. They share a common set of functions, displays, or dataref values. This has led to the development of very specific buttons representation.

- Flight Control Unit display (in both horizontal and vertical modes)
- Flight Management Annunciators display

These buttons are highly specific and would probably not be usable in other aircrafts. However the very specific code used to produce these buttons is an example for alternative development.
