Observables are data that is constantly monitored. When the data matches a criteria, a set of actions is executed.

For people familiar with the concept, it can be considered a *if-this-then-that* instruction. For example: If the weather data from the simulator indicates rain is falling on the aircraft, we can set the windshield wipers automatically.

Observables are defined at three levels:

1. the cockpit level, available for the entire application, mostly all the time,
2. the simulator level, available to monitor simulator-specific variables,
3. the aircraft level, available to monitor aircraft-specific variables.

Observables are defined in `resources` folder of the entity in a `observables.yaml` file. All observables are loaded at once in an Observables entity which contains them all and report their use .

# Definition of Observables

The file `observables.yaml` is located in the `deckconfig/resources` folder of an aircraft. It is loaded on startup.

```
observables:
  - name: example
    trigger: onchange
    dataref: some/dataref/to/check
    actions:
      - command: do/some/action
        delay: 5
```

## Attribute

### Observables

The `observables` attribute is a list of individual observables.

# Observable

## Attributes

### Type

What triggers the observable.

#### Trigger

`type: trigger`

The list of action is carried over when the value of the observable is True (or non zero).

#### Value Changed

`type: onchange`

Another method to trigger the flow of action(s) is to select theÂ *value changed* mode. Actions get executed as the value of the dataref or of the computation has changed.

#### Event

`type: event`

The observable will look for the `event` or `events` attributes and register interest in the events listed under these attributes.

Each time the simulator software will report those events, the actions will be carried over.

### Actions

The `actions` attribute is a list of individual actions that gets carried out in sequence if the trigger attribute is True.

# Action

## Attributes

An action as the same attribute as a command carried out by a button:

- instruction
- delay
- condition

# Examples

Here are a few examples of Observables, set from experience.

## Simulation Event

### Internal Changes

When a new aircraft is loaded, or when an aircraft livery is changed, "internal" events are generated by the simulator software so that external entities like Cockpitdecks can be notified.

This is how Cockpitdecks detects aircraft or livery changes. Action triggered are very specific (to change the aircraft).

So, internally, Cockpitdecks uses an Observable that monitors a simulator variable that changes when a new aircraft or mivery is loaded. This depends on the

## Aircraft Events

### Auto Save on Event

Most simulators or aircrafts provide a command to save the situation and restore it later.

ToLiss aircrafts simulate Airbus which have the concept of [flight phase](https://www.aviationhunt.com/airbus-a320-flight-phases/).

We devised an Observable to trigger a situation save on flight phase change. This allows to restart a flight right at the flight phase change.
