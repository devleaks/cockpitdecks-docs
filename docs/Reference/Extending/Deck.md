When a new deck device appears, it is necessary to introduce it to Cockpitdecks.

First, the capabilities of the devices will need to be enumerated into a Deck Type.

Second, it might be necessary to create a deck driver to interface the device with Cockpitdecks.

Events produced on the device and reported by the driver will need to be transformed into Deck Events injected into Cockpitdecks.

Reciprocally, when Cockpitdecks will generate a representation, the driver will transform it and install it on the deck device.
