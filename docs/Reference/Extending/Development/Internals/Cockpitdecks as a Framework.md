Cockpitdecks was created to solve the specific problem of connecting desktop decks devices to a flight simulator software. It appears in the code vocabulary.

However, with an additional level of abstraction, the simulation software is connects to:

- does not need to be a *flight* simulation software. It could be train simulation, truck, car, boat, you name it.
- does not need to be a *simulation* software.

Any « external » software that can be driven by desktop deck and that provides feedback through an API can be used with Cockpitdecks. Conditions remain on the software Cockpitdecks connects to that it offers an interface to issue instructions and to read feedback from.
