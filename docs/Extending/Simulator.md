The Simulator represent the simulator software and contains all procedures necessary for interaction with the Flight Simulation software.

There currently is only one type of flight simulation software supported and it is Laminar Research X-Plane (release 12 onwards).

(It is possible to create a new Simulator implementation for another software.)
