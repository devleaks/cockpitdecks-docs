An Instruction is some piece of code that needs to be carried out. There are several types of instructions:

- SimulatorInstruction need to be carried out in the simulator, hence, they are sent over to the simulator for execution.
- CockpitdecksInstruction are performed "inside" Cockpitdecks. Cockpitdecks instructions are like loading a new page on a deck, restarting decks or stopping Cockpitdecks.
